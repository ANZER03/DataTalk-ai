DataTalk-ai is an AI-powered application designed to assist data experts in manipulating and analyzing data using Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides an intuitive interface, built with Streamlit, to connect to various data sources (SQL databases, CSV, Excel files) and interact with the data through natural language queries and Python code generation.

## Features ðŸš€

-   **Intuitive Streamlit Interface:** A user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.
-   **Multi-Source Data Connection:** Connect to various databases (SQLite, MySQL, SQL Server) and file formats (CSV, Excel).
-   **Intelligent LLM Interaction:** Powered by Google Generative AI (Gemini) for natural language understanding and code generation.
-   **SQL Querying & Execution:** Translate natural language into SQL queries, execute them, and display results.
-   **Pandas Data Manipulation:** Perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis with AI-generated Python (Pandas) code.
-   **Plotly Data Visualization:** Generate a wide range of interactive charts and plots.
-   **Comprehensive Dashboard Creation:** Create integrated HTML dashboards from multiple visualizations.

## How it Works ðŸ§ 

DataTalk-ai streamlines data operations through the following key functionalities:

1.  **Data Connection:**
    *   Users can easily connect to various data sources, including SQLite, MySQL, and SQL Server databases.
    *   The application also supports uploading and processing CSV and Excel files.

2.  **LLM Interaction:**
    *   The core intelligence of DataTalk-ai is powered by the Google Generative AI (Gemini) model.
    *   It interprets user prompts in natural language to generate appropriate SQL queries for database interactions or Python code for data manipulation and visualization.

3.  **SQL Querying:**
    *   For connected databases or loaded files (which are processed in-memory using DuckDB), users can pose natural language questions.
    *   The LLM translates these questions into syntactically correct SQL queries, executes them, and displays the results in a tabular format.

4.  **Data Manipulation (Pandas):**
    *   Data experts can issue natural language commands to perform various data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks on their DataFrames.
    *   The LLM generates the corresponding Python (Pandas) code, executes it, and presents the modified DataFrame to the user.

5.  **Data Visualization (Plotly):**
    *   The application enables users to request a wide range of interactive data visualizations.
    *   The LLM generates Plotly code to create insightful charts based on the user's requirements and the current state of the data.

6.  **Dashboard Creation:**
    *   Beyond individual visualizations, DataTalk-ai offers the capability to generate comprehensive HTML dashboards.
    *   These dashboards seamlessly integrate multiple Plotly figures, providing a holistic view of the data insights.

## Installation

To set up DataTalk-ai on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataTalk-ai.git
    cd DataTalk-ai
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Google Gemini API Key:**
    *   Obtain a Google Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```

6.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    The application will open in your default web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start interacting with your data. Here's a brief guide:

1.  **Connect to a Data Source:**
    *   On the left sidebar, select the type of data source you want to connect to (SQL Database, CSV, or Excel).
    *   Provide the necessary connection details or upload your file.
    *   Click the "Connect" or "Upload" button.

2.  **Interact with Data (Querying, Manipulation, Visualization):**
    *   Once connected, you will see a chat interface and a data display area.
    *   **Natural Language Queries:** Type your questions or commands in natural language (e.g., "Show me the top 10 customers by sales," "Clean the 'price' column by removing null values," "Create a bar chart of product categories").
    *   **Code Generation:** The AI will generate and execute the appropriate SQL or Python (Pandas/Plotly) code based on your input.
    *   **View Results:** The results (tables, modified DataFrames, or charts) will be displayed in the main area.

3.  **Create Dashboards:**
    *   You can request the AI to create a dashboard by asking something like, "Create a dashboard showing sales trends and customer demographics."
    *   The application will generate an HTML dashboard with integrated visualizations.
